# Weather Dashboard
> We were to create a weather dashboard using APIs.
# GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity

# Completed
I was unable to get the API to work. My dashboard is non functional. I was unable to get the subject to be entered into the API search. My key was functional but the responses were not functional. I craeted a dashboard and a current day locations. I as well craeted a clear button that was supposed to remove local storgae space of researched cities. All oft hese aspects were nonfunctional.
